# Dimension Warp

Survive on a platform warping between alternate dimensions of places you know, defend against the locals and escape!

## Disclaimer

While I know this mods look a lot the original warptorio(s), this one is also different in the fact it is not a update of them.

This mod was written from scratch, as I wanted to learn how to make mods (and at the end, I had fun making it). This also explains why it's not using the same name.

## Features / Changes

* Works **with or without** Space Age.
* The timer doesn't start immediatly but after some automation science pack have been crafted (red potions).
* **Energy between surfaces** are linked using built-in engine feature, so you can see your consumption from everywhere correctly.
* **Dimensions techs** have been added to provide a bit of **QoL** (damage, drone speed, ...)
* **Harvesters platforms** and the ability to put miners while not deployed
* **Enemies** have been added to almost **all surfaces** (except Aquilo) and pollution spread everywhere.
* Except Aquilo (Factorio limitation), **all planets have variations** that are randommly selected when warping.
* **Loaders are included** in the mod to be used, and support item stacking [space-age only]
* **Items stacks and spoilage have been reworked**. This can be turned off in the settings for a vanilla experience of this.
* **Space related stuff** (rocket cost, foundation, space buildings) are **more expensive**.
* **Dimension agricultural tower** [space-age only]: a new type of agricultural tower, that draws energy from base and teleport seeds / fruits automatically from / to base.
* Gleba is hard. I mean it.

## Compatibilities

* Vanilla / Space-Age
* Krastorio2 (should work)
* AAI Industry / Loaders / Containers

## Q&A

**Why do some mod techs have high costs (surface size, warp timer)?**<br>
*The goal is to make player chose between mandatory tech to progress, and expensive/long tech to ease the game*

**Only 2 harvesters ?!**<br>
*This is really enough, and easy enough. I won't add any more.

**Why is feature XXXX from warptorio not here**<br>
*When I decided to make this mod, I only wanted features I liked / felt useful. I'm open to suggestion, but it doesn't mean I will add anything*

**Why didn't you update warptorio instead**<br>
*While the people involved in Warptorio did a great job, the code of the mod felt overwhelming. Also, I wanted to do it from scratch to understand how mods work, not just "fixing stuff"*

## Known issues

[Repair Turret](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Repair_Turret) crash the game if you put them in Harvesters, when you recall harvesters with deconstruction planner. Otherwise, the usage of this mod is fine.
